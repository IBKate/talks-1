A talk I gave for my research lab about [PyDy](https://github.com/pydy/pydy),
[SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy), and my experience in [Google Summer of
Code](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014).

Slides are available [here](https://speakerdeck.com/jcrist/multibody-dynamics-with-sympy-and-pydy).

The demo is a modified version of the [inverted-pendulum
example](https://github.com/pydy/pydy/tree/master/examples/npendulum) in the
PyDy Repo. To try the demo out for yourself, you need the following:

- SymPy ([git-master](https://github.com/sympy/sympy))
- numpy
- scipy
- ipython
- matplotlib
- [python-control](https://github.com/python-control/python-control)
- A C compiler (such as `gcc`)

You can also view the demo on [nbviewer
here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jcrist/talks/blob/master/pydy_talk/pydy_talk_demo.ipynb)
