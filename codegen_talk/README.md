A talk I gave on code generation for PyMNtos.

Slides are available [here](https://speakerdeck.com/jcrist/generating-fast-and-correct-code-with-sympy).

To try the demo out for yourself, you need the following:

- sympy (at least [sympy-0.7.5-git](https://github.com/sympy/sympy))
- numpy
- ipython
- A C compiler (such as `gcc`)
- A Fortran compiler (such as `gfortran`)

You can also view the demo on [nbviewer here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jcrist/talks/blob/master/codegen_talk/codegen_talk.ipynb)
