A presentation given for ME 8287: Advanced Robotics with Medical Applications,
at the University of Minnesota, on using Python for rigid body dynamics analysis
and control.

In it I discuss the Python scientific ecosystem,
[SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy), and the
[PyDy](https://github.com/pydy/pydy) workflow.

Slides are available [here](https://speakerdeck.com/jcrist/python-for-the-dynamicist).

The demo is a modified version of the [inverted-pendulum
example](https://github.com/pydy/pydy/tree/master/examples/npendulum) in the
PyDy Repo. To try the demo out for yourself, you need the following:

- SymPy
- numpy
- scipy
- ipython
- matplotlib
- [python-control](https://github.com/python-control/python-control)
- A C compiler (such as `gcc`)

You can also view the demo on [nbviewer
here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jcrist/talks/blob/master/dynamics_talk/dynamics_talk_demo.ipynb)
